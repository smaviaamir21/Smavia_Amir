📘 C++ Programming Practice Repository
👩‍💻 About This Repository

This repository contains my C++ programming practice work as part of my journey in Software Engineering.
It includes programs written to strengthen my logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of core C++ concepts.

The repository is continuously updated as I learn and practice new topics.

🧠 Topics Covered (and Upcoming)
🔹 Programming Fundamentals (PF)

Basic input/output

Variables and data types

Conditional statements

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Functions

Arrays and basic logic building

🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and objects

Constructors and destructors

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Function and operator overloading

File handling using classes

🔹 Future Additions

STL (Vectors, Maps, Sets)

Exception handling

Advanced OOP concepts

Small C++ projects

📂 Repository Structure

The programs are organized into folders according to topics, for example:

PF_Programs/

OOP_Programs/

Each folder contains topic-wise practice programs written for learning and revision.

🎯 Purpose

To build a strong foundation in C++

To maintain a well-organized practice record

To showcase my coding consistency and learning progress

To prepare for exams, interviews, and future projects

🚀 Learning Status

This repository is a work in progress and will grow as I continue learning C++ in more depth.
