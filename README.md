# C++ Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains my practice codes, assignments, and small projects related to **Programming Fundamentals using C++**.
It is designed to track my learning journey, cover core concepts, and serve as a reference for myself and others.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes examples and exercises on the following topics:

1. **Basic Syntax & Structure**

   * `#include`, `main()`, `cout`, `cin`
   * Print statements, comments, escape sequences

2. **Data Types & Variables**

   * int, float, double, char, string, bool
   * Constants and type casting

3. **Operators & Expressions**

   * Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement

4. **Control Flow**

   * `if`, `else if`, `else`
   * `switch` statements
   * Nested conditions

5. **Loops**

   * `for`, `while`, `do-while`
   * Nested loops

6. **Functions**

   * Defining and calling functions
   * Parameters, return values
   * Function overloading

7. **Arrays & Strings**

   * 1D and 2D arrays
   * String handling basics

8. **Structures & Pointers**

   * User-defined data types
   * Pointers and pointer operations

9. **File Handling**

   * Reading from and writing to files

10. **Mini Projects**

* Calculator
* Budget Management App
* Railway Reservation System
* Weather Data Analyzer
